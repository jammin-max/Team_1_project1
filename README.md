<p align="justify">Since the rise of COVID-19 in 2020, we have all faced the effects of a Global Pandemic. In many states across the United States a “Stay-At-Home Order”, or other restrictions were put in place, ensuring many Americans were confined to the compounds of their homes. In a time where movie theaters were closed and social distancing was enforced, our means of quality entertainment was put to the test. Netflix was there to save the day, creating a "New Normal'' for Americans to binge watch Netflix, and “Chill” in the comfort of their homes, in a capacity that has never been seen before. </p>

<p align="justify">Our team has chosen to analyze the effects of the 2020 Pandemic Era and its correlation to Netflix ratings, revenue, subscribers, and their changes over the last year. We took a deeper dive into looking at the number of movie releases by genre on Netflix, and of the North American countries; United States, Canada, and Mexico, which produced the most TV-MA rated TV Shows.  To take things a step further, we took a look at the top 10 movies on Netflix in 2020 based on average overall IMDB ratings and examined the correlation between male and female average movie ratings. Lastly, we graphed a comparison of the number of Netflix TV Shows and Movies for 2020 to understand what selections Americans had to choose from. </p>
